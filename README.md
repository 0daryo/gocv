# Go OpenCV3

Go bindings for the [OpenCV 3](http://opencv.org/) computer vision package.

Supports the latest OpenCV v3.3

Uses C-style wrapper around the OpenCV 3 C++ classes to avoid having to deal with applying SWIG to a huge existing codebase.

Based on code from https://github.com/sensorbee/opencv
